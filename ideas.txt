What info to show

First, have a handful of tickers pre-selected (my favorites) and show the lat 30 days of performance.

this should be a chart with the the ticker symbol below the chart.  probably takes up the top 20% of the screen?
Should I add some intraday values for this too?

then if if you click the symbol - take you to the fundamental information of that company.

Add some options for the charts - make it able to show any of the 5 data points (open, close, low, high, volume)
